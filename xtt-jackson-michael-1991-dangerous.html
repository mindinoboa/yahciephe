                            <p> Hey everyone sorry about the delay it’s been a hectic day at work, but without further ado here is the all-time roster for my favorite team, the Saints. How did I select my team? Longevity, productivity, and impact were definitely the biggest factors for all of my selections. It took an extremely productive couple of seasons to earn a spot on the all-time roster and there are a few players who managed to make their way on the list. I also only focused on the players time with the franchise. It makes me so sad that the world and that people treated Michael this way. It's tragic because from all the videos/interviews I've seen, he was a gentle, pure-hearted man. He truly only wanted to do good, and just because he was eccentric (which he could never avoid due to his upbringing and magnitude of his stardom), and the world couldn't understand him, they tore him down for it. I believe Michael was really one of the most amazing people to ever grace the Earth. No other musician, actor/act.

Is there anyone here who knows more about him? He was considered one of the best sources on MJ’s pedophiliac relationships, according to Diane Dimond and others who think MJ was guilty, but according to the staunch MJ defenders, he was a member of NAMBLA who wrote fantasies about Michael and boys. What’s the real deal? I know he was sued by MJ for claiming he saw a sex tape of Michael and a boy, and basically went bankrupt and fled the country, I think that all happened in 1998.

So let me preface this by restating a personal theory of mine regarding Trump: while he exhibits fascist sympathies and ran an openly fascist campaign, he does not have a truly coherent personal ideology beyond reacting to external stimuli. This is because he is very stupid. He probably can't even conceive of the concept of ideology. As a result of this, and the well-known tendency that he is basically Reagan on metaphorical crack - the last person in the room with him wins - his regime Going through old issues of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter and posting highlights in my own words.

Referred by him as ‘short films’ ever since 1983, his work transformed the music video into an art form and a promotional tool through complex story lines, dance routines, special effects and famous cameo appearances, simultaneously breaking down racial barriers. His videos became some of the most acclaimed, awarded and recognized of all time, however his legac. If you believe Michael Jackson was a child sex abuser, he made some very interesting choices for album titles. Maybe his behaviour was subconsciously or even consciously broadcasted through his album titles. Around the time of “Off The Wall” and “Thriller” there are no major child sex abuse allegations that I’m aware of, except that phone call made to Terry George in the late 1970s. But I guess you could interpret those album titles as Michael acknowledging that he’s weird, a bit “off the wall”. I know I'm not the first to do this - but it was my first time doing a challenge such as this. It started off fun and by September I started to get burnt out. But I'm really glad I got around to finishing my challenge! I only wanted to do one movie a day, and no more - however two days later in the year I was an overachiever and did two ha! There were a few days I had to get creative only in terms of limitations of what my day brought about- whether it be a day where I attended say Comic-Con. ###Pop Essentials 3.0: The Poptimist's Playbook Welcome to my Pop Essential Albums List 3.0, my third attempt at curating the uncuratable: a definitive list of the most important, most influential, and most high quality pop music albums from the 1950s until the modern era. We'll dive deeper into what that means in a sec. If you haven't yet, take a look at my two previous attempts at making a list like this: A True Pop Essentials List (https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/408uj.

One that comes to mind for me is Shania Twain with her album Come On Over , which was released in November 1997. The twelfth and final single from the album was released almost three years later in July 2000. Michael Jackson’s Dangerous and HIStory albums were also still releasing singles over 2 years after their respective release dates. Dangerous was released in November 1991, and had it not been for Michael checking into rehab in late 1993, Dangerous would have been released A considerable amount actually. Please don't begin reading this at work. There is a lot of material here and reading through it will take you a bit of time. If your boss catches you it could get you in trouble, as it's hard to imagine that this won't be a distraction from you job. Besides the reading factor alone however, there is a substantive amount to contrast between each individual, and much to meditate on. These differences extend beyond merely career, education, upbringing Edit : The years 1950-1975 have been added, bringing the total to 201. I decided to divide these up according to year: 1950 : No Way Out (https://youtu.be/eEsRfQd9lbw) - A black doctor is assigned to treat two racist white, robbery suspects who are brothers, and when one dies, it causes tension that could start a race riot. Stage Fright (https://youtu.be/iNVlqWL4UnA) - A struggling actress tries to help a friend prove his innocence when he's accused of murdering the husband. Yesterday, we have examined the bodies strewn about the battlefield, let’s take a look at the six who are in, this time starting with the Top 3 from the Pacific League. Pacific League Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6WJQdTpwNw) The Fighters are about as even-keel a squad as you can get. Their offense has been middle of the pack in pretty much every offensive category this year, with their pitching picking up the slack.
